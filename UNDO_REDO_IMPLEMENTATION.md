# Undo/Redo Implementation - Step 3.4

## Overview
Comprehensive undo/redo functionality has been added to the canvas editor, allowing users to reverse and reapply their drawing actions with keyboard shortcuts and UI buttons.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **src/lib/canvasHistory.js** (NEW)
A robust history management class that handles undo/redo state:

**Key Features:**
- Maintains two stacks: `undoStack` and `redoStack`
- Maximum history of 50 states (configurable)
- Prevents state saving during undo/redo operations
- Compresses canvas state as JSON strings

**Methods:**
- `saveState(canvasJSON)` - Saves current canvas state to undo stack
- `undo(currentState)` - Restores previous state and returns it
- `redo(currentState)` - Restores next state and returns it
- `canUndo()` - Returns true if undo is available
- `canRedo()` - Returns true if redo is available
- `clear()` - Clears both stacks
- `getUndoCount()` / `getRedoCount()` - Returns stack sizes
- `isUndoRedoInProgress()` - Checks if currently performing undo/redo

### 2. **src/components/editor/Canvas.jsx** (UPDATED)
Integrated history system into the main canvas component:

**New State:**
- `canUndo` / `canRedo` - Boolean flags for button states
- `historyManagerRef` - Reference to CanvasHistory instance
- `saveTimeoutRef` - Reference for debounced saves

**New Functions:**
- `saveToHistory(canvasData)` - Debounced save (500ms) to history
- `handleUndo()` - Performs undo operation and updates canvas
- `handleRedo()` - Performs redo operation and updates canvas

**Canvas Event Listeners:**
- `object:added` - Triggered when objects are added
- `object:modified` - Triggered when objects are modified
- `object:removed` - Triggered when objects are removed
- `path:created` - Triggered when free drawing paths are created

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` - Undo
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` - Redo
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Y` - Redo (alternative)

### 3. **src/components/editor/Toolbar.jsx** (UPDATED)
Added undo/redo buttons to the toolbar:

**New Props:**
- `canUndo` (boolean) - Whether undo is available
- `canRedo` (boolean) - Whether redo is available
- `onUndo` (function) - Callback for undo action
- `onRedo` (function) - Callback for redo action

**New UI Elements:**
- Undo button with curved arrow left icon (↶)
- Redo button with curved arrow right icon (↷)
- Both buttons show tooltips with keyboard shortcuts
- Buttons are disabled when no undo/redo is available
- Visual feedback on hover with scale animation

## How It Works

### State Management Flow
1. User performs an action on canvas (draw, add object, modify, delete)
2. Canvas fires an event (`object:added`, `object:modified`, etc.)
3. Event handler triggers `saveToHistory()` with debounce (500ms)
4. After 500ms of inactivity, state is saved to `undoStack`
5. `redoStack` is cleared (new action invalidates forward history)
6. UI updates to enable/disable undo/redo buttons

### Undo Operation
1. User presses Ctrl+Z or clicks undo button
2. `handleUndo()` is called
3. Current state is saved to `redoStack`
4. Previous state is retrieved from `undoStack`
5. Canvas is loaded with previous state
6. Canvas re-renders with restored state
7. State is saved to database via `onCanvasChange`
8. Redo button becomes enabled

### Redo Operation
1. User presses Ctrl+Shift+Z/Ctrl+Y or clicks redo button
2. `handleRedo()` is called
3. Current state is saved to `undoStack`
4. Next state is retrieved from `redoStack`
5. Canvas is loaded with next state
6. Canvas re-renders with restored state
7. State is saved to database via `onCanvasChange`

### Memory Management
- Maximum 50 states in undo stack (configurable)
- Oldest states are automatically removed when limit is reached
- Redo stack is cleared when new action is performed
- Flag prevents saving during undo/redo to avoid corruption
- Debouncing prevents excessive state saves (500ms delay)

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- Undo/Redo buttons are positioned at the top of the toolbar
- Buttons are disabled (grayed out) when action is not available
- Hover effects provide visual feedback
- Tooltips show keyboard shortcuts on hover
- Buttons scale up slightly on hover when enabled

### Keyboard Shortcuts
All shortcuts work unless:
- User is typing in an input/textarea element
- User is editing text directly on canvas

**Shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Z` (Mac) - Undo
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Z` (Mac) - Redo
- `Ctrl+Y` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Y` (Mac) - Redo (alternative)

### Error Prevention
- Prevents undo/redo during text editing
- Prevents undo/redo when typing in form fields
- Prevents recursive saves during undo/redo operations
- Validates state exists before attempting restore

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Basic Functionality:**
- [x] Draw something, press Ctrl+Z to undo
- [x] Press Ctrl+Shift+Z to redo
- [x] Click undo/redo buttons
- [x] Verify buttons are disabled when no history

✅ **Multiple Actions:**
- [x] Draw multiple strokes
- [x] Undo each one in reverse order
- [x] Redo them in forward order
- [x] Verify state at each step

✅ **Different Tools:**
- [x] Test undo/redo with pen tool
- [x] Test undo/redo with shapes (line, rectangle, circle)
- [x] Test undo/redo with text
- [x] Test undo/redo with eraser

✅ **Edge Cases:**
- [x] Undo when nothing to undo (button should be disabled)
- [x] Redo when nothing to redo (button should be disabled)
- [x] Perform action after undo (clears redo stack)
- [x] Verify keyboard shortcuts don't interfere with text editing

✅ **Performance:**
- [x] Debouncing prevents excessive saves
- [x] Maximum 50 states prevents memory issues
- [x] Canvas renders smoothly during undo/redo

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Visual History Timeline:**
   - Show thumbnails of previous states
   - Allow jumping to any point in history

2. **History Persistence:**
   - Save history to IndexedDB
   - Restore history when reopening note

3. **Branch History:**
   - Allow exploring multiple paths
   - Tree-based history instead of linear

4. **Selective Undo:**
   - Undo specific objects
   - Layer-based undo

5. **History Statistics:**
   - Show number of undo/redo states available
   - Display in status bar or tooltip

## Notes

- The history system is self-contained and doesn't affect existing functionality
- All canvas events are properly cleaned up on unmount
- The implementation follows React best practices with hooks and refs
- State changes trigger database saves automatically via `onCanvasChange`
- The system is extensible and can be easily enhanced with additional features

## Completion Status

1. ✅ Created `src/lib/canvasHistory.js` with full history management
2. ✅ Updated `src/components/editor/Canvas.jsx` with history integration
3. ✅ Updated `src/components/editor/Toolbar.jsx` with undo/redo buttons
4. ✅ Implemented keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y)
5. ✅ Added debouncing (500ms) to prevent excessive saves
6. ✅ Proper state management prevents memory leaks
7. ✅ Visual feedback and disabled states work correctly
8. ✅ All code compiles without errors
